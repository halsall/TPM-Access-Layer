Low Level Access Layer
----------------------

Provides a C++ library which can communicate with FPGA boards. Currently
it only implements the UCP protocol, such that it can communicate with
UniBoards and Tile Processing Modules

A python wrapper is also included for scripting and interactive managements
of the boards

Directory structures
--------------------

\- doc      Contains any documentation
 - python   Python wrapper
 - scripts  Helper scripts, including a mock_tpm script to debug communication
 - src\
       - library  The C++ library implementation
       - server   A protobuf/zermoq wrapper for RPC calls (required for current user interface)

Comiling the library
--------------------

cd src/library
make

Compiling the server
--------------------

Requirements: - zeromq   (4.1.0)
              - protobuf (2.6.0) Note: Read make file in case of different version

cd src/server
protoc --cpp_out=. message.proto (Only needs to be performed once, or when message.proto changes)
make

Using the Python wrapper
------------------------

No setup file exists yet, so the following needs to be added:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path_to_project/src/library

Requirements: enum34 (pip should install it)

cd python
